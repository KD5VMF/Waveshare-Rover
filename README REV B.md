# Enhanced Autonomous Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance System REV B for Waveshare Rovers

This project embodies the REV B version of an advanced navigation and obstacle avoidance system designed for Waveshare Rovers, leveraging the precision of LiDAR (FHL-LD19) technology. It significantly improves upon previous versions by incorporating advanced light intensity analysis for obstacle detection, providing a more nuanced approach to navigation in varied environments.

Features
Dynamic Obstacle Detection: Utilizes LiDAR sensory data to detect obstacles, with an enhanced focus on light intensity metrics for more accurate environmental assessment.
Intelligent Navigation Decision-Making: Employs advanced algorithms to decide on movement strategies based on the rover's surroundings, optimizing for safety and efficiency.
Robust Serial Communication: Establishes and maintains serial connections with both the rover and LiDAR sensor for reliable data transmission.
Error Handling and System Resilience: Features comprehensive error management protocols to ensure system stability under various conditions.
Modular Design: Facilitates ease of modification and extension, catering to a wide range of developmental and educational applications.
