"""
Enhanced Dynamic Autonomous Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance System for Waveshare Rovers with Angular Resolution Optimization (REV D)

About:
This advanced script elevates autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance for Waveshare Rovers, leveraging sophisticated LiDAR processing capabilities of the FHL-LD19 unit. Optimized for Raspberry Pi 4, the system introduces enhanced dynamic safety margins and refined object recognition. Utilizing scanning speed, angular resolution, and intensity data from LiDAR, it enables precise maneuvering across varied terrains. Key updates include real-time adjustments based on angular resolution, empowering the rover to navigate complex environments with unparalleled accuracy.

Features:
- Dynamic Obstacle Detection: Employs LiDAR for in-depth obstacle recognition by analyzing distance, intensity, and scanning dynamics.
- Adaptive Navigation: Adjusts dynamic safety margins in real-time based on LiDAR scanning speed and point density for smarter pathfinding.
- Advanced Environmental Perception: Incorporates light intensity and point cloud analysis for detailed environmental understanding and object differentiation.
- Optimized Angular Resolution: Utilizes LiDAR's angular resolution data for immediate navigation strategy adjustments, enhancing environmental adaptability.
- Enhanced Decision Making: Introduces complex algorithms for strategic navigation, taking into account rover's orientation and environmental complexity for accurate obstacle avoidance.
- Modular Design: Features a structured, easily adaptable codebase for customization and further development across educational, developmental, and research applications.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- pyserial package for serial communication
