"""
Title: Advanced Rover Obstacle Avoidance System

About:
This Python script embodies an advanced navigation and obstacle avoidance system,
specifically designed for Waveshare Rovers equipped with LiDAR (FHL-LD19) sensor. It establishes
and manages serial connections with the Waveshare rover and its LiDAR sensor, adeptly
processing real-time LiDAR data to intelligently detect and navigate around obstacles.
Using a Raspberry Pi 4 as the main controller, key features include dynamic obstacle
detection, decision-making based on sensor input, and executing movement commands
tailored to the rover's context. Designed with robustness in mind, it includes
comprehensive error handling and is structured into clear sections for configuration,
utility functions, LiDAR processing, and main logic.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- pyserial package for serial communication
